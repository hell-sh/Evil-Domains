# Evil-Domains

Basically another hosts file project.

Looking for Email Spam Domains? Check out [Email-Filters](https://github.com/hell-sh/Email-Filters).

## Outputs

It is not recommended to only use this list as your hosts file, as it is lacking a lot of other evil domains, which are already in other lists. I recommend a list which is automatically being filled by lots of lists like this one, like [the Collective Hosts File Project by Hell.sh](https://hell.sh/hosts).
