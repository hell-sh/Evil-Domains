Basically another hosts file project.

## Outputs

It is not recommended to only use this list as your hosts file, as it is lacking a lot of other evil domains, which are already in other lists. I recommend a list which is automatically being filled by lots of lists like this one, like [the Netdex Collective Hosts File Project](https://netdex.co/hosts/).
